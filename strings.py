## Applying what we've learned

## Describe the sketch comedy group
## Create a variable with their name (Monty Python)
name="Monty Python"
## Create a short description in the form of a string assigned to a variable (Monty Python was a British comedy group)
desc="Monty Python was a British comedy group"
## Create a variable assigned to a number that represents the year they were formed (1969)
year_formed = 1969

## Introduce the group in a sentence
## Assign a variable whose value will be a concatenation of the above variables into a sentence that makes sense.
long_desc="Group Name: '{0}'.\nDesc: '{1}'.\nYear formed: '{2}'".format(name,desc,year_formed)
print(long_desc)
## Using the above variables, write the sentence in two different ways that we have learned to concatenate strings, numbers and variables in a print() statement to avoid a TypeError (Hint: Use + and ,)
print(name, "|",desc + ".","They were formed in",year_formed)
